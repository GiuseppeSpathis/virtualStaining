# Virtual Staining (H&E → CK7 IHC) — Research Project

This repository contains code and experiments for virtual staining in computational pathology: generating CK7 immunohistochemistry (IHC)-like images from standard H&E kidney cancer tiles using a diffusion-based model (PixCell) with lightweight LoRA adaptation in an unpaired setting (no aligned H&E/IHC pairs). 

For a complete description of the methodology, dataset/preprocessing, and evaluation, see the project [report](https://github.com/GiuseppeSpathis/virtualStaining/blob/main/report.pdf).
